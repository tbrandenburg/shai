{"author":"tbrandenburg","body":"@task Create a jupyter notebook christmas calendar for my 13 year old son. The plan should have a notebook-creation-task for each day from 1 to 24. Each day is a separate jupyter notebook. It should be runnable and compatible with Google Colab.\nEach jupyter notebook should be fun and inspiring while explaining the topic pedagogically. It should leverage nice experiments and diagrams. Also references to further readings should be added. Pack the explanations into chistmas themes or stories. Add gossips around the theories.\nAt the end of each notebook add a main task to be fulfilled by my son.\n\nThose are the topics:\n\n\t1.\tExploring Infinity: Countable vs. Uncountable Sets\n\t2.\tThe Beauty of Limits: Understanding Convergence\n\t3.\tDerivatives Beyond Slopes: A Deep Dive into Differentiability\n\t4.\tIntegrals as Areas and More: The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus\n\t5.\tVector Spaces: What Makes a Space Linear?\n\t6.\tBasis and Dimension: Building Blocks of All Vector Spaces\n\t7.\tEigenvalues and Eigenvectors: The Language of Transformations\n\t8.\tFourier Series: Decomposing Signals into Sines and Cosines\n\t9.\tIntroduction to Real Analysis: ε-δ Proofs Made Friendly\n\t10.\tTopology Basics: Open Sets and Continuous Maps\n\t11.\tMetric Spaces: Distances in Abstract Worlds\n\t12.\tGroup Theory: Symmetries Everywhere\n\t13.\tRings and Fields: The Algebraic Structures Behind Numbers\n\t14.\tComplex Numbers and the Argand Plane\n\t15.\tComplex Functions and the Cauchy–Riemann Equations\n\t16.\tDifferential Equations: Modeling Change\n\t17.\tPartial Differential Equations: Heat, Waves, and Laplace\n\t18.\tManifolds: Curved Spaces in Higher Dimensions\n\t19.\tTensor Calculus: The Language of General Relativity\n\t20.\tProbability Theory: Random Variables and Distributions\n\t21.\tMeasure Theory: What Is “Size” Really?\n\t22.\tNumerical Methods: Computing the Impossible\n\t23.\tChaos Theory: When Simple Rules Make Wild Behavior\n\t24.\tFractals and Self-Similarity: Beauty in Infinite Detail","comments":[],"title":"Jupyter Notebook Christmas Calendar"}
