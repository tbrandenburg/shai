# Issue #26 — Jupyter Notebook Christmas Calendar

## Original Post by @tbrandenburg

@task Create a jupyter notebook christmas calendar for my 13 year old son. The plan should have a notebook-creation-task for each day from 1 to 24. Each day is a separate jupyter notebook. It should be runnable and compatible with Google Colab.
Each jupyter notebook should be fun and inspiring while explaining the topic pedagogically. It should leverage nice experiments and diagrams. Also references to further readings should be added. Pack the explanations into chistmas themes or stories. Add gossips around the theories.
At the end of each notebook add a main task to be fulfilled by my son.

Those are the topics:

	1.	Exploring Infinity: Countable vs. Uncountable Sets
	2.	The Beauty of Limits: Understanding Convergence
	3.	Derivatives Beyond Slopes: A Deep Dive into Differentiability
	4.	Integrals as Areas and More: The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
	5.	Vector Spaces: What Makes a Space Linear?
	6.	Basis and Dimension: Building Blocks of All Vector Spaces
	7.	Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: The Language of Transformations
	8.	Fourier Series: Decomposing Signals into Sines and Cosines
	9.	Introduction to Real Analysis: ε-δ Proofs Made Friendly
	10.	Topology Basics: Open Sets and Continuous Maps
	11.	Metric Spaces: Distances in Abstract Worlds
	12.	Group Theory: Symmetries Everywhere
	13.	Rings and Fields: The Algebraic Structures Behind Numbers
	14.	Complex Numbers and the Argand Plane
	15.	Complex Functions and the Cauchy–Riemann Equations
	16.	Differential Equations: Modeling Change
	17.	Partial Differential Equations: Heat, Waves, and Laplace
	18.	Manifolds: Curved Spaces in Higher Dimensions
	19.	Tensor Calculus: The Language of General Relativity
	20.	Probability Theory: Random Variables and Distributions
	21.	Measure Theory: What Is “Size” Really?
	22.	Numerical Methods: Computing the Impossible
	23.	Chaos Theory: When Simple Rules Make Wild Behavior
	24.	Fractals and Self-Similarity: Beauty in Infinite Detail

## Context
Create a festive 24-day Jupyter notebook calendar for a 13-year-old learner, delivering one Colab-ready notebook per day that blends advanced math topics with playful Christmas storytelling, engaging experiments, diagrams, references, and a closing task for each notebook.

## Role Descriptions
### Role: Concept Curator
Purpose: distill the requested topics into a structured learning arc that balances difficulty with excitement. Focus: coverage accuracy, pacing across 24 days, clarity of objectives. Style: concise outlines anchored in pedagogy and seasonal motifs.

### Role: Story Weaver
Purpose: craft narratives, gossip-style anecdotes, and friendly explanations around each topic. Focus: tone, accessibility for a motivated teen, hooks that keep the holiday spirit alive. Style: imaginative yet informative prose with clear calls to action.

### Role: Notebook Engineer
Purpose: transform outlines and narratives into runnable Google Colab notebooks with experiments, diagrams, and references. Focus: technical correctness, reproducibility, consistent structure across 24 files. Style: precise instructions, well-commented code cells, and practical guidance.

## Chronologic Task List
- [x] [Concept Curator] Build Advent blueprint — Read `output/26/issue_conversation.md`, list all 24 topics with target learning goals, seasonal hooks, experiment ideas, and end-of-notebook task prompts; save the structured outline to `output/26/notebook_blueprint.md`.
  * Summary: Created `notebook_blueprint.md` with 24 day-by-day goals, festive hooks, experiments, and closing tasks ready for downstream agents.
- [x] [Story Weaver] Draft narrative modules — Use `output/26/notebook_blueprint.md` to expand each day into story beats, friendly explanations, gossip snippets, and reference pointers; write the detailed narratives to `output/26/narrative_modules.md` with clear per-day subsections.
  * Summary: Crafted per-day narratives with hooks, teen-friendly prose, and references inside `narrative_modules.md`.
- [x] [Notebook Engineer] Define Colab scaffolds — Consult both `output/26/notebook_blueprint.md` and `output/26/narrative_modules.md` to specify the cell order, code/markdown mix, visualization libraries, and experiment setup for each notebook; document the per-day scaffolding guide in `output/26/colab_scaffolds.md`.
  * Summary: Prepared `colab_scaffolds.md` with 24 detailed cell-flow guides, tool choices, and experiment cues ready for notebook assembly.
- [x] [Notebook Engineer] Produce delivery checklist — Review `output/26/colab_scaffolds.md` and outline the concrete steps to instantiate 24 runnable notebooks (including filenames, shared assets, and verification steps); record the final execution checklist in `output/26/calendar_delivery_plan.md` so future agents can build the notebooks without rereading prior documents.
  * Summary: Documented `calendar_delivery_plan.md` with naming schema, shared assets, and verification workflow so notebook builders can proceed without revisiting upstream files.
