# Issue #26 — Jupyter Notebook Christmas Calendar

## Original Post by @tbrandenburg

@task Create a jupyter notebook christmas calendar for my 13 year old son. The plan should have a notebook-creation-task for each day from 1 to 24. Each day is a separate jupyter notebook. It should be runnable and compatible with Google Colab.
Each jupyter notebook should be fun and inspiring while explaining the topic pedagogically. It should leverage nice experiments and diagrams. Also references to further readings should be added. Pack the explanations into chistmas themes or stories. Add gossips around the theories.
At the end of each notebook add a main task to be fulfilled by my son.

Those are the topics:

	1.	Exploring Infinity: Countable vs. Uncountable Sets
	2.	The Beauty of Limits: Understanding Convergence
	3.	Derivatives Beyond Slopes: A Deep Dive into Differentiability
	4.	Integrals as Areas and More: The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
	5.	Vector Spaces: What Makes a Space Linear?
	6.	Basis and Dimension: Building Blocks of All Vector Spaces
	7.	Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: The Language of Transformations
	8.	Fourier Series: Decomposing Signals into Sines and Cosines
	9.	Introduction to Real Analysis: ε-δ Proofs Made Friendly
	10.	Topology Basics: Open Sets and Continuous Maps
	11.	Metric Spaces: Distances in Abstract Worlds
	12.	Group Theory: Symmetries Everywhere
	13.	Rings and Fields: The Algebraic Structures Behind Numbers
	14.	Complex Numbers and the Argand Plane
	15.	Complex Functions and the Cauchy–Riemann Equations
	16.	Differential Equations: Modeling Change
	17.	Partial Differential Equations: Heat, Waves, and Laplace
	18.	Manifolds: Curved Spaces in Higher Dimensions
	19.	Tensor Calculus: The Language of General Relativity
	20.	Probability Theory: Random Variables and Distributions
	21.	Measure Theory: What Is “Size” Really?
	22.	Numerical Methods: Computing the Impossible
	23.	Chaos Theory: When Simple Rules Make Wild Behavior
	24.	Fractals and Self-Similarity: Beauty in Infinite Detail
