# Issue #41 — RAG

## Original Post by @tbrandenburg

@task Turn this jupyter notebook https://colab.research.google.com/github/docling-project/docling/blob/main/docs/examples/rag_langchain.ipynb into one main python file
and test it with a dummy PDF.
Keep it very simple and just turn the notebook steps into one python file.
Run it without an HuggingFace token.
Embed it in an uv project.
I want to run it with "uv run pyrag"
