# 30-Day Execution Roadmap — Compliance Automation Control Room

| Week | Objective | Key Activities | Accountable Roles / Skills | Tangible Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Week 1: Discovery & Risk Scoping | Align plant stakeholders on compliance automation scope and success criteria. | • Run joint workshop translating UR/Flexxbotics configurations into GMP requirements.<br>• Inventory existing validation artifacts, OT security posture, and MES/PLC interfaces.<br>• Prioritize blueprint modules and SOC monitoring rules tied to risk register.<br>• Define acceptance metrics (validation cycle time, security thresholds, uptime SLAs). | Business Strategist (facilitation), Automation Program Lead, QA/Reg Affairs Manager, OT Security Architect. | Discovery brief with personas/goals, risk & control matrix, prioritized blueprint backlog, signed-off success metrics. |
| Week 2: Secure Integration Sprint I | Harden infrastructure and lay down zero-trust foundation. | • Install Zero-Trust OT Gateway hardware/software and connect to cobot cells.<br>• Configure privileged-access workflows, credential rotation, and SOC alert routing.<br>• Map change-control workflows to 21 CFR Part 11 steps inside management console.<br>• Draft initial validation blueprint population (environmental monitoring, aseptic filler). | Solutions Architect (OT/IT), Security Engineer w/ SOC tooling, Compliance Engineer, Plant Controls Lead. | Operational gateway, credential roster & rotation schedule, documented change-control workflows, first-pass blueprint templates filled with baseline data. |
| Week 3: Secure Integration Sprint II | Complete integrations and validation automation packages. | • Build low-code connectors for UR, Flexxbotics, and MES/ERP per prioritized backlog.<br>• Run automated test scripts, capture logs for audit trail, and remediate findings.<br>• Finalize validation blueprint library with digital SOPs and evidence attachments.<br>• Prepare persona dashboards with live telemetry feeds and role-based permissions. | Low-Code Integration Specialist, Test Automation Lead, Quality Documentation Lead, Data Engineer. | Connector studio project files, automated test reports, validated SOP packet, configured persona dashboards with sample data. |
| Week 4: Operationalization & Launch | Train personas, finalize governance, and launch MVP + managed service. | • Conduct AR/remote-enabled training for Automation, QA, Operations personas.<br>• Hand off audit-ready dossier (validation summary, SOC attestations, compliance evidence).<br>• Establish post-launch runbooks for deviation response, SOC monitoring, and uptime reporting.<br>• Final readiness review; go/no-go sign-off and MVP launch announcement tot stakeholders. | Customer Success Lead, QA Training Manager, SOC Manager, Operations Director. | Completed training attendance + competency logs, signed audit dossier, runbooks/SLA playbooks, MVP launch memo and governance calendar. |

## Sequencing Notes
- Weeks 2–3 contain parallelizable technical work; maintain a shared Kanban with dependency tags (gateway readiness precedes connector deployment).
- Embed rapid feedback loops by slotting 30-minute daily huddles between Automation, QA, and Security leads to unblock validation evidence capture.
- Track success metrics weekly: validation cycle-time reduction, SOC critical findings (<2), and dashboard uptime to prove MVP readiness for pilot expansion.
