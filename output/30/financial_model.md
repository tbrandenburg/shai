# Financial Model - Compliance Automation Control Room

## Revenue & Commercial Assumptions
- **Packaging:** Each GMP robotics cell launch combines a $55K implementation/validation kit plus a $12K/month managed compliance subscription that activates once the line is live.
- **Client ramp:** The go-to-market push targets 12 design-partner style facilities over six months (1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3 new wins respectively) aligned with the roadmap's weekly milestones.
- **Usage:** Subscription revenue begins the same month a client signs because onboarding compresses into the four-week playbook defined in the strategy brief.
- **Payment terms:** 30% deposit at contract signature (captured inside the implementation fee) and 30-day payment cycles on subscriptions keep AR exposure low.

## Expense Structure Assumptions
- **Build/Product team ($70K/mo base)**: Controls the validation blueprint library, low-code connector studio, and SOC content. Variable $5K per new client covers hardware staging, licenses, and compliance documentation packaging.
- **GTM ($25K/mo base)**: Covers one enterprise seller plus marketing ops; $5K per new client commission + on-site travel.
- **Operations & Managed Service ($20K/mo base)**: SOC tooling, QA leads, and customer success pods. Variable $3K per active client for 24/7 monitoring, patch windows, and deviation response runbooks.
- **Other costs** (legal, admin) assumed inside base figures; capex is light because pilots leverage client-owned cobots.

## 6-Month Projection & Break-Even Outlook
| Month | New Clients | Active Clients | Implementation Revenue ($K) | Subscription Revenue ($K) | Total Revenue ($K) | Total Expenses ($K) | Net Cash Flow ($K) | Cumulative Cash ($K) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 55 | 12 | 67 | 128 | -61 | -61 |
| 2 | 1 | 2 | 55 | 24 | 79 | 131 | -52 | -113 |
| 3 | 2 | 4 | 110 | 48 | 158 | 147 | 11 | -102 |
| 4 | 2 | 6 | 110 | 72 | 182 | 153 | 29 | -73 |
| 5 | 3 | 9 | 165 | 108 | 273 | 172 | 101 | 28 |
| 6 | 3 | 12 | 165 | 144 | 309 | 181 | 128 | 156 |

### Interpretation
- **Break-even timing:** Monthly cash flow turns positive in Month 3 and cumulative cash crosses zero in Month 5 once nine clients are live, meaning the model recovers initial burn within ~150 days of launch.
- **Cash requirement:** Peak cash deficit is **-$113K in Month 2**, so reserving $150K of working capital (or equivalent credit) protects against slips in customer signature or payment.
- **Unit economics:** Fully loaded delivery cost averages $25K per client in the first six months (implementation + six months of service), leaving >50% contribution margin per deal once run-rate volume exceeds eight active clients.
- **Sensitivity levers:** A one-client slip shifts break-even by roughly one month; conversely, adding a $10K security add-on upsell per client would add $120K annualized without materially increasing cost because SOC tooling scales linearly.
