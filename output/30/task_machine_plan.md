## Context
The goal is to design a micro-business plan for a niche B2B market, covering the value proposition, MVP concept, 30-day launch sequence, financial outlook, and competitor differentiation while coordinating dedicated agents for research, synthesis, modeling, and strategy.

## Role Descriptions
- **Market Research Analyst** — Investigates specialized B2B segments, validates market gaps with credible data, and packages findings so others can act decisively; communication is structured and source-driven.
- **Business Strategist** — Synthesizes research into positioning, product direction, and execution moves, balancing clarity with persuasive storytelling to keep the plan cohesive and actionable.
- **Financial Modeler** — Translates strategic inputs into revenue, cost, and cash-flow projections, emphasizing transparent assumptions and tidy tables that make the economics easy to audit.

## Chronologic Task List
- [x] [Market Research Analyst] Map niche B2B landscape — Choose a narrowly defined B2B segment with available data, gather quantitative indicators (market size, spend trends, unmet needs), profile at least three incumbent solutions, and document sourced findings plus citations in `output/30/market_research.md` so downstream roles have a fact base.
  * Summary: Documented GMP-focused robotics integration fact base with IFR/QNX data and UR, PTC, Flexxbotics profiles in `output/30/market_research.md`.
- [x] [Market Research Analyst] Distill actionable insights — Read `output/30/market_research.md`, extract the top market gaps, target buyer personas, and competitor weaknesses, and summarize them as bullet insights with supporting data points in `output/30/research_insights.md` for strategic use.
  * Summary: Captured compliance/security gaps, buyer priorities, and incumbent weaknesses with sourced bullets in `output/30/research_insights.md`.
- [x] [Business Strategist] Define UVP, MVP, and differentiation — Read `output/30/research_insights.md`, craft a unique value proposition tied to quantified gaps, outline a minimal viable product (core features, user journey, success metrics), and build a competitor differentiation matrix comparing the proposed offer to incumbents; store all sections in `output/30/strategy_brief.md`.
  * Summary: Captured the Compliance Automation Control Room UVP, MVP, and competitor matrix in `output/30/strategy_brief.md` for downstream teams.
- [x] [Business Strategist] Build 30-day execution roadmap — Using `output/30/strategy_brief.md`, draft a four-week plan with weekly objectives, key activities, accountable roles/skills, and tangible deliverables that lead to an MVP launch; capture it in `output/30/roadmap.md`.
  * Summary: Produced week-by-week objectives, activities, roles, and deliverables in `output/30/roadmap.md` to steer the MVP launch sequence.
- [x] [Financial Modeler] Create projection model — Reference `output/30/research_insights.md` and `output/30/strategy_brief.md` to list revenue assumptions (pricing, acquisition pace), expense structure (build, GTM, operations), and produce a simple month-by-month projection with break-even analysis plus cash needs; save the model narrative and tables to `output/30/financial_model.md`.
  * Summary: Logged pricing, ramp, expense drivers, and a 6-month break-even/cash outlook in `output/30/financial_model.md`.
